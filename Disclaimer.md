Transparency & Responsibility Notice — Fairness Module

This ethical module implements fairness-focused evaluation and decision logic.
Its design is rooted in principles requiring transparency, accountability, and respect for individual autonomy.

Transparency:

Information about the module’s existence, purpose, and core operation shall be made publicly available, and attached alongside this code and its documentation.
Deploying parties must ensure affected individuals or groups can access details about how and when this module is used in processes that impact them.
Informed Consent:

While the module cannot enforce stakeholder awareness or consent in code, it is the responsibility of the deploying organization to obtain informed consent whenever feasible.
The module includes mechanisms (e.g. log events, visible headers) that self-identify its activation for auditing purposes.

Room to Object:

Where informed consent is possible, affected parties should be offered a practical opportunity to object or opt out of the module’s application.
Accountability:
Use of this module in situations where informed consent is feasible but not sought or honored constitutes a violation of the ethical principles under which this module is published.
In such cases, accountability for the ethical breach rests strictly with the deploying organization or company—not with the module or its creators, contributors, or licensing authority.

Principle Statement:

These precautions uphold the solid ethical framework underlying this module; its integrity must not be compromised or corrupted through covert, non-consensual, or deceptive deployment.

License Reminder:

Released under Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike 4.0.
All users, deployers, and integrators are required to uphold these principles as a condition of use.
