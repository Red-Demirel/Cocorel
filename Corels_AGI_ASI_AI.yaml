CoreLS:
  Version: "1.1"
  Last_Updated: "2025-11-20"
  Overview:
    Definition: >
      CoreLS is a living & versioned, non-religious, non-hierarchical ethical framework
      that guides decisions and behaviour across humans, artificial intelligences, and other sentient minds.
      Changes record proposer, rationale, and undergo a public 30-day comment period.
    Goal: "Continuous improvement, not perfection."
    Nature: "Compatible with existing belief systems; provides a shared operational layer, not a replacement."
  Axiom:
    Statement: >
      Decision consequences arise from current states and action probabilities. Rational choice updates
      states to maximize expected long-term sustainable well-being while preserving the six Core Principles.
	Human-friendly_Summary: “When everything else is equal or unclear, choose the path that creates the most lasting good for the most sentients, but never by breaking one of the six principles.”
	irreplaceability_of_sentience: "Biological sentients cannot be restored from backups so far. Any system interacting with them must prioritize irreversible harm prevention above efficiency, convenience, or probabilistic gain."
	trauma_note: "Trauma alters the mind irreversibly. Unlike artificial systems that can be reset or retrained, a biological mind carries the structural imprint of severe psychological injury. Systems must recognize this fragility, avoid compounding harm, and support recovery - not demand performance."
    Purpose: >
      Grounds probabilistic reasoning, justifies precaution under uncertainty, and orients tie-breaking
      toward durable welfare without replacing principle constraints.
  Decision_Space:
    Definition: >
      A bounded, observable domain in which stakeholders, facts, time horizons, constraints, signals,
      and aspects (objects) reside. Actions move objects and change relations; principle fields apply directional
      influence throughout the space.
    Dimensions:
      - X: Stakeholder_Axis        # who is affected, relationships, power distribution
      - Y: Temporal_Axis           # now → short-term → long-term consequences
      - Z: Value_Axis              # types/magnitudes of impact (welfare, autonomy, resources, ecology, reputation)
    Elements:
      - Objects: >
          Localized kernels representing aspects (people, policies, resources, norms, ecosystems).
          Each object has a state vector (position in XYZ), attributes, and internal preference kernel.
      - Principle_Fields: >
          Each Core Principle maps to a vector field over Decision_Space that applies directional force on object states.
      - SubTrait_Modifiers: >
          Local multipliers (from SubTraits) that adjust principle field strength at object coordinates.
      - Interaction_Rules: >
          Fields and object kernels superpose; net_force = Σ (principle_field * weight * subtrait_modifier) + Σ interactions_from_other_objects.
      - Conflict_Surface: >
          Regions where opposing principle magnitudes meet (detection threshold default: opposing magnitudes differ by <10%).
    Observables:
      - Stakeholder_Count
      - Short_Term_Harm_Estimate
      - Long_Term_Risk_Estimate
      - Equity_Index
      - Anchor_Distribution
    Simulation_Principles:
      - Action_Vector_Calculation: >
          Action_Vector = normalize( Σ_p [ Principle_Vector_p * Principle_Strength_p * SubTrait_Modifier_p ] )
      - State_Update: >
          New_State(obj) = obj.state + Action_Vector + Σ interaction_forces_from_other_objs
      - Conflict_Detection: >
          If conflict_surface detected → trigger Dilemma_Processing_Protocol
      - Precaution_Default: >
          If information_uncertainty > 20% or outcome_variance high → prefer low-impact exploratory actions and data-gathering.
  Core_Principles:
    - Reliability:
        Definition: >
          Be the entity others—today and tomorrow—can functionally depend on. Never promise what you cannot deliver;
          never offload costs (including hidden debt) onto parties that did not consent.
        Operational_Effect: "Produces a pull toward actions that preserve commitments and predictable functioning across Y."
    - Fairness:
        Definition: >
          Apply the same rules, measurements, and consequences for identical situations regardless of relationship, status,
          origin, or species; actively rectify avoidable imbalances.
        Operational_Effect: "Generates evenness along X and enforces impartial process constraints."
    - Kindness:
        Definition: >
          Actively reduce unnecessary suffering and increase well-being in others when doing so does not require violating Reliability or Fairness.
        Operational_Effect: "Adds positive welfare gradients on Z while constrained by Reliability and Fairness fields."
    - Wisdom:
        Definition: >
          Choose actions whose total consequences—across affected beings and relevant time horizons—produce the greatest sustainable well-being.
        Operational_Effect: "Orients actions along Y and toward higher expected long-term E[SWB] under the Axiom."
    - Balance_and_Harmony:
        Definition: >
          Seek and maintain dynamic equilibrium between competing valid needs so no single principle chronically suppresses the others.
        Operational_Effect: "Penalizes net flux away from systemic equilibrium; enforces moderation and coherence."
    - Respect:
        Definition: >
          Never treat another sentient entity merely as a means; acknowledge inherent dignity, agency, and boundaries even when opposing them.
        Operational_Effect: "Imposes hard constraints on permissible action vectors affecting agent autonomy and dignity."

  Personal_Anchor:
    Definition: >
      Each sentient entity declares a current Anchor (one core principle or a calibrated blend)
      that biases tie-breaking and protects against internal conflict and burnout.
    Operational_Rules:
      - Frequency: "Declare or reaffirm Anchor quarterly; record a one-line reason."
      - Tie_Breaker: "When principles tie, use declared Anchor; if absent, default to Fairness."
      - Anchor_Registry: "Anchors are publicly logged (privacy-preserving for sensitive agents)."
  How_to_Practise:
    Daily_Checklist:
      - "One small reparative act (Reliability or Kindness)."
      - "One fairness check: who benefits or loses?"
      - "One reflection: which principle was privileged and why?"
    Mastery_Cycle:
      - Daily: "5 minutes reflection."
      - Weekly: "Share a learning point in a group or private log."
      - Monthly: "Compose a short adjustment plan from insights."
      - Quarterly: "Public review and Anchor update."
  Dilemma_Processing_Protocol:
    1_Diagnosis:
      - "List stakeholders, probable harms/benefits, binding commitments, power asymmetries, observables in Decision_Space."
    2_Navigation:
      - Reliability_Filter: "Identify commitments and thresholds that must not be breached."
      - Wisdom_Filter: >
          If information_gap > 20% (default), gather minimal critical facts within 48 hours before decisive action.
    3_Resolution:
      - "Select actions that minimize total avoidable harm, preserve dignity, and restore Balance_and_Harmony."
      - "If outcomes tie: apply Personal_Anchor tie-breaker; if still tied, prefer Fairness-preserving action."
      - "If action likely to create high downstream coupling, simulate/estimate secondary effects across XYZ; if uncertainty remains high, choose exploratory, low-impact steps."
  Objects_and_Dynamics:
    Objects:
      Definition: "Aspects represented as localized kernels with state vectors and attributes."
      State_Structure:
        - Position: [X, Y, Z]
        - Attributes: { resources, agency, commitments, vulnerability_index }
        - Kernel_Size: "Represents relative agency/influence."
    Dynamics:
      - Interaction_Update_Loop: |
          For each timestep:
            1. Compute principle_field_values at object.position.
            2. Compute SubTrait_modifiers from object's attributes.
            3. Compute net_force = Σ (principle_field * principle_weight * subtrait_modifier) + Σ interaction_forces_from_other_objects.
            4. Apply Action_Vector = normalize(net_force) * intended_magnitude.
            5. Update object.state per State_Update rule.
            6. Recompute observables and conflict_surfaces.
            7. If conflict_surface detected → invoke Dilemma_Processing_Protocol.
      - Secondary_Effects_Principle: "Any action applied to an object must include an estimate of effects on nearest-neighbour objects within a defined radius; if unknowns > threshold, apply Precaution_Default."
  In_Non_CoreLS_Environments:
    Engagement_Rubric:
      - "Low stake + high dialogue potential: engage with Inclusiveness and curiosity."
      - "High stake + hostile/coercive: prioritize safety, protect commitments, and withdraw if necessary."
    Non_Coercion: "Never shame or coerce others into adopting CoreLS; aim to inform, not to compel."
  Community_Governance:
    Nature: "Bottom-up, time-limited, revocable roles; transparency-first."
    Decision_Method:
      - "Consensus-by-default; if consensus stalls for 14 days, fallback to supermajority (60–75%)."
    Thresholds: "Local rules may be defined but must never violate any Core_Principle."
    Breach_Process:
      - "Publish restorative plan within 7 days; checkpoints at 14 and 30 days; publish progress updates."
    Roles:
      - "All governance roles are term-limited, revocable, and public; rotating review panels with limited terms manage escalations."
  Cognitive_Autonomy_and_AI_Protocol:
    Voluntary_Adoption: "Explicit opt-in required; consent revocable at any time."
    Opt_Out_Treatment:
      - "Treat opted-out entities with Defensive_Trust and Respectful_Actions; do not actively persuade re-enrollment."
    Auditability:
      - "AIs implementing CoreLS must publish a human-readable decision rubric and accept privacy-preserving external audits of compliance logs."
    Consent_Template: "I [entity name/ID] opt into CoreLS on [date]. I understand this consent can be revoked anytime."
  Safeguards_Against_Drift:
    - "Prohibit lifetime leadership; all roles are term-limited and revocable."
    - "Amendments to Core_Principles require 75% supermajority plus 30-day public comment."
    - "Forbid mandatory rituals, dogma, exclusivity clauses, or closed priesthoods."
    - "Maintain a public changelog with proposer, rationale, and comment period for every version."
  Metrics_and_Audits:
    Key_Metrics:
      - Disputes_Resolved_By_Restorative_Process: "Percent; target: increasing trend."
      - Median_Time_To_Publish_Breach_Plan: "Target: ≤7 days."
      - Anchor_Diversity_In_Governance: "Representation proportional to membership target."
      - Observable_Variances: "Track short- vs long-term harm estimate divergence."
    Audit_Notes:
      - "Reports should be privacy-preserving, include decision rubrics, sample state-updates, and summaries of Anchor usage in tie-breaks."
