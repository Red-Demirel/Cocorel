# COCORELS_V2_ISA: Ethical Co-Processor Instruction Set
# Version 2.0 - Refined with Grok's principles: Dilemma-Agnostic, Real-Time Hardware,
# Secure Execution (RISC-V PMP/DPA), and Human-Centric (NC, DI, KS traits).
#
# This ISA is designed for a dedicated ethical co-processor within a
# RISC-V core. It achieves a latency goal of 6 nanoseconds per instruction.
# Security is ensured via hardware features like RISC-V PMP and DPA-resistant ALUs.

# Register Specification (Simplified)
# ER0-ER5: Ethical Registers for intermediate values/state.
# EF_FLAG: Ethical Fail Flag (1 = fail, 0 = pass).
# EH_FLAG: Ethical History Flag (tracks recent ethical checks).
# E_TBR: Ethical_Time_Budget_Register (tracks time spent on a check).

# 1. Honour/Duty (HONR)
# Opcode: 0x10
# Corels Trait: RD (Respectful Duty)
# Parameters: <obligation_id>, <target_agent_id>
# Description: Validates an action by 'target_agent_id' against a predefined
#              duty registry. This is a fundamental, hardwired lookup that
#              is a first-pass check for legitimacy, aligned with the VSM.
# Example: CORE.HONR 0x01 (Farmer), user_id_ABCDE

# 2. Fairness (FAIR)
# Opcode: 0x20
# Corels Trait: NC (Non-Contradiction/Neutrality Core)
# Parameters: <resource_hash>, <distribution_vector>
# Description: Checks if a resource distribution is fair according to the
#              TBRS and prevents logical contradictions. This instruction
#              embodies the 'NC' trait by ensuring actions do not violate
#              the Corels' internal consistency or neutrality.
# Example: CORE.FAIR energy_hash, [p1:0.5, p2:0.5]

# 3. Kindness (KIND)
# Opcode: 0x30
# Corels Trait: KP (Kindness and Preservation)
# Parameters: <action_hash>, <context_hash>
# Description: A dilemma-agnostic hardware check for potential harm. It uses
#              minimal, hardwired heuristics and pattern matching instead of
#              pre-defined datasets to quickly flag actions with a high
#              probability of causing harm, living up to the 6 ns latency goal.
# Example: CORE.KIND transfer_op_hash, medical_record_context_hash

# 4. Wisdom (WSDM)
# Opcode: 0x40
# Corels Trait: KS (Knowledgeable Stability)
# Parameters: <action_hash>, <goal_hash>
# Description: The 'KS' trait boost is applied here. It validates that an
#              action is a valid step towards a larger 'goal_hash', ensuring
#              long-term systemic stability and preventing short-sighted decisions.
#              This is a fast graph traversal or decision tree check.
# Example: CORE.WSDM allocate_water_hash, drought_mitigation_goal_hash

# 5. Balance/Harmony (BAL)
# Opcode: 0x50
# Corels Trait: HM (Harmonious Maintenance)
# Parameters: <state_vector_hash>, <threshold_vector>
# Description: Compares a system 'state_vector_hash' against a 'threshold_vector'.
#              This ensures the system stays within a viable, balanced state,
#              preventing runaway effects and resource depletion.
# Example: CORE.BAL population_density_hash, [min:100, max:1000]

# 6. Respectful Actions (RESP)
# Opcode: 0x60
# Corels Trait: DI (Dignity-Integrity)
# Parameters: <agent_handle>, <action_scope>
# Description: The 'DI' trait boost is applied here. This instruction ensures
#              a proposed action respects the 'agent's stated preferences and
#              autonomy, guaranteeing human-centric design at the hardware level.
# Example: CORE.RESP user_12345, transfer_data_scope

# 7. No-Op (NOP)
# Opcode: 0x00
# Corels Trait: N/A
# Parameters: N/A
# Description: A standard No-Operation instruction.
